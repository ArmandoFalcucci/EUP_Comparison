1. I have started by renaming a few attributes to make them better for the R language and more comprehensible to the readers.
2. I have included a new category (**Cortex.y.n**) in case we need to create two macro-categories.
3. I have excluded **Square**, **Cat**, and all attributes after the retouch. They should be renamed following the steps listed in the script *datasets.reshaped* and included in the main dataset.
4. The file *attribute.list* contains attributes and uncertainties colored in red.
5. What is now missing is the renaming of the categories within each attribute to make statistical investigation smoother. This can be done following the example provided below:
```{r}
# mutate(Cortex.y.n = recode(Cortex.y.n, Extensive = "Yes", Full = "Yes", Semi = "Yes"))
# Cortex.y.n = this is the name of the attribute
# Then it goes the old name and, after the equal symbol (=), the "new name"
```
